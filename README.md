# Hello User

This is a work in progress, and currently no guarantee of the scripts workability is provided.
But, feel free to use and please let me know if you find anything misbehaving.

# Purpose

The idea is to provide a clear, sharp, R-oriented toolkit for commonly performed pre-processing of expression-based
matrices. The tools are designed to be easily incorporated in a Snakemake workflow, meaning that they
take specific files and writes specific files.
